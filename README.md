# SLUH Rocket League Custom Overlay

This repository is for a custom Twitch overlay for St. Louis University's Rocket League team. <br>
It programmatically updates and displays game information using the [SOS-Plugin](https://gitlab.com/bakkesplugins/sos/sos-plugin), authored by SimpleAOB on GitLab, for BakkesMod. <br>
The overlay uses the SOS-Plugin to open an event relay between the game and itself. <br>
To run, open terminal and input `npm start`. The overlay will run on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) <br>
Written in Typescript using React as the framework. <br>
Other technologies used include HTML, CSS, Node, and Vite as the build tool. <br>
